Here’s a basic structure to create a GitHub repository template for your project, which can be adapted based on your needs. This template follows best practices and includes common elements.

Step-by-step Guide:

1. Initialize the repository: You can either create the repository directly on GitHub or locally using Git commands.


2. Repository structure:

├── .github
│   ├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE
│   │   ├── bug_report.md
│   │   └── feature_request.md
│   ├── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
├── docs/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── src/
│   ├── <project_code_files>
├── tests/
│   ├── <test_code_files>
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── setup.py
└── CHANGELOG.md



Key Files and Directories:

1. .github/:

Contains GitHub-specific templates for issues and pull requests.

ISSUE_TEMPLATE/:

bug_report.md: Template for bug reports.

feature_request.md: Template for feature requests.


PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md: Template for pull request descriptions.



2. docs/:

README.md: A more detailed project description.

CONTRIBUTING.md: Guide for contributors on how to get involved.



3. src/:

This directory contains your source code files. The project’s main logic and APIs can go here.



4. tests/:

This directory holds your unit tests and other test files.



5. .gitignore:

Lists files and directories Git should ignore (e.g., *.pyc, .env, etc.).



6. LICENSE:

Define the license under which your project is distributed (e.g., MIT, GPL, Apache).



7. README.md:

The main description of your repository, including installation instructions, usage, and a general project overview.



8. requirements.txt:

A list of dependencies for the project.



9. setup.py:

Script for package distribution and installation. Includes metadata about the project (e.g., name, version, description, dependencies).



10. CHANGELOG.md:

A record of all major changes and versions for your project.





---

You can automate the creation of this structure with the following steps:

To create the repository template on GitHub:

1. Navigate to GitHub and create a new repository.


2. Choose "Template repository" in the settings so it can be cloned as a template for future projects.



Local Commands:

To set this up in your local environment, run the following commands:

mkdir my_project_template
cd my_project_template

# Create directories
mkdir -p .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE
mkdir docs src tests

# Create basic files
touch .gitignore LICENSE README.md requirements.txt setup.py CHANGELOG.md
touch .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md
touch .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
touch docs/README.md docs/CONTRIBUTING.md

# Initialize Git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with basic project structure"
